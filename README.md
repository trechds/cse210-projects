## CSE 210 C# Projects

Welcome to the CSE 210 C# Projects repository! This is where the coursework, assignments, and projects for the CSE 210 course are showcased. In this course, the principles of programming with classes using C# are explored, including concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, all in the context of software development.

### Course Overview

CSE 210 introduces the fundamental concepts of programming with classes. The course covers how to design software using class-based principles, enabling the creation of flexible, maintainable, and cost-effective software solutions. The primary programming language used in this course is C#, and no prior experience with C# is expected. Instead, students are encouraged to build upon their understanding of programming principles gained in CSE 111: Programming with Functions.

### Folders Description

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `final` - Starter projects for final project.
